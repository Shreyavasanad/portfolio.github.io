            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)</strong> course provides a comprehensive understanding of algorithmic strategies, efficiency analysis, and their real-world applications. Algorithms form the backbone of computational systems, enabling us to solve complex problems efficiently.</p>
            <p>Throughout the course, we explored various data structures, including arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, heaps, and hash tables. Additionally, we delved into algorithmic techniques like recursion, backtracking, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms.</p>
            <p>Real-time applications of these concepts are evident in areas such as route optimization, database indexing, artificial intelligence, network design, and financial modeling. Understanding DAA bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical problem-solving, equipping us with the tools to address challenges across industries.</p>
