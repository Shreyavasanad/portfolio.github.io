            <h2>Identify Housing Needs and Market Demand</h2>
             <h2>SDG 1: No Poverty:</h2>
            <p> Understanding the scale of housing shortages, particularly for low-income families and vulnerable populations, directly supports poverty reduction efforts. If we can identify and address the housing needs of those most in need, we can help lift people out of poverty by ensuring they have access to safe, affordable housing.</p>
             <h2>SDG 10:Reduced Inequalities:</h2>
            <p>Disparities in access to affordable housing often exacerbate social inequalities. By analyzing housing data and identifying groups who are marginalized (such as racial minorities, refugees, or low-income workers), we can work to reduce these inequalities by ensuring equitable access to housing for all, regardless of socioeconomic status or background.</p>

            <h2>Construct Housing Units</h2>
           <h2>SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth:</h2>
            <p>The construction of housing creates jobs across various sectors, from labor to supply chain management, architecture, and engineering. By ensuring that these jobs meet decent labor standards, we help promote economic growth and improve livelihoods in the construction sector.</p>
             <h2>SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities:</h2>
            <p> The act of building housing itself is critical in the development of well-functioning and inclusive cities. It ensures that there is sufficient housing for growing urban populations, and it can be done sustainably to create resilient, future-proof communities.</p>
