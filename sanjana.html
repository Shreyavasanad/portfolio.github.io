            <h2>Ensure Long-Term Affordability and Community Sustainability</h2>
           <h2>SDG 1: No Poverty</h2>
            <p>Housing affordability is crucial for long-term poverty prevention. If housing prices rise too rapidly or are not maintained as affordable over time, families may face economic hardship. Maintaining long-term affordability ensures that families continue to have access to safe, secure housing without falling back into poverty.</p>
             <h2>SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities:</h2>
            <p> Sustainable Cities and Communities – Long-term sustainability means creating vibrant, resilient communities that can thrive over time. This involves ongoing support for residents, ensuring that neighborhoods remain inclusive, safe, and vibrant. Community sustainability could include initiatives like local job creation, social programs, and maintenance of public spaces that foster a strong community identity.</p>
